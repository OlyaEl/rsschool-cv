## About me
Hi, my name is Olya! I am 31 years old. I currently work in the field of visa issues of the Schengen countries. But I decided to learn something new and interesting.
I liked web development because it is interesting to watch how an ordinary entry of many symbols, letters and signs eventually turns into a beautiful and animated page on a computer monitor, smartphone or tablet screen.
